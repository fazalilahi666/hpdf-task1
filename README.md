# HPDF Week-1 Task

This is a the first task of HPDF 2017.
It just has a single server.js file that returns responses to various requests.
And that just solves the purpose of the task...

npm install (as usual to install the dependncies)

Following are the various requests you can make:
1. Hello world is displayed on application startup

2. /authors : displays a list of authors and thier posts count from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

3. /setcookie creates a cookie with name and age key-value pairs
and /getcookies displays the cookie set

4. /html displays plain html. /image displays an image

5. /robots.txt gives a forbidden request

6. /input displays a textbox. On submit, the text entered is displayed.
